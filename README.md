## What is this project
A Work in Progress basic physics engine, using [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/) to handle the graphics. Especially focused on basics of soft-body mechanics.

## How to run
Until I set up Docker or WASM, `cargo run` (cargo required).

## State of the project

#### Working
- Drawing basic entities
- Basic rigid body 
- User interaction to create entities
- Soft-body dynamics
- Soft-body generation

#### TODO
- Create UI restrictions
- Setup CI
- Define soft-body user interaction
- Prevent tunnelling
- Implement soft-body self collision
