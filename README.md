## What is this project

A work in progress Physics Engine, using [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/) to handle the graphics. Especially focused on basics of soft-body mechanics.

## How to run

Until I set up Docker or WASM, `cargo run` (`cargo` required).

## State of the project

#### Working

- Drawing basic entities
- Basic rigid body
- User interaction to create entities
- UI restrictions
- Soft-body dynamics
- Soft-body generation

#### TODO

- Prevent tunnelling
- Add friction
